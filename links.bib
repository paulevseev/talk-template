  abstract = {Raman spectroscopy has been recognized to be a powerful tool for label-free
	discrimination of cells. Sampling methods are under development to
	utilize the unique capabilities to identify cells in body fluids
	such as saliva\{,\} urine or blood. The current study applied optical
	traps in combination with Raman spectroscopy to acquire spectra of
	single cells in microfluidic glass channels. Optical traps were realized
	by two 1070 nm single mode fibre lasers. Microflows were controlled
	by a syringe pump system. A novel microfluidic glass chip was designed
	to inject single cells\{,\} modify the flow speed\{,\} accommodate
	the laser fibres and sort cells after Raman based identification.
	Whereas the integrated microchip setup used 514 nm for excitation
	of Raman spectra\{,\} a quartz capillary setup excited spectra with
	785 nm laser wavelength. Classification models were trained using
	linear discriminant analysis to differentiate erythrocytes\{,\} leukocytes\{,\}
	acute myeloid leukaemia cells ({OCI}-{AML}3)\{,\} and breast tumour
	cells {BT}-20 and {MCF}-7 with accuracies that are comparable with
	previous Raman experiments of dried cells and fixed cells in a Petri
	dish. Implementation into microfluidic environments enables a high
	degree of automation that is required to improve the throughput of
	the approach for Raman activated cell sorting.},

  abstract = {We report on integrated optofluidic Raman-activated cell sorting ({RACS})
	platforms that combine multichannel microfluidic devices and laser
	tweezers Raman spectroscopy ({LTRS}) for delivery, identification,
	and simultaneous sorting of individual cells. The system allows label-free
	cell identification based on Raman spectroscopy and automated continuous
	cell sorting. Two optofluidic designs using hydrodynamic focusing
	and pinch-flow fractionation are evaluated based on their sorting
	design and flow velocity effect on the laser trapping efficiency
	at different laser power levels. A proof-of-principle demonstration
	of the integrated optofluidic {LTRS} system for the identification
	and sorting of two leukemia cell lines is presented. This functional
	prototype lays the foundation for the development of a label-free
	cell sorting platform based on intrinsic Raman markers for automated
	sampling and sorting of a large number of individual cells in solution.},

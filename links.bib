	abstract = {We report on the realization of long-range dielectric-loaded surface plasmon polariton waveguides ({LR}-{DLSPPWs}) consisting of straight and bent subwavelength dielectric ridges deposited on thin and narrow metal stripes supported by a dielectric buffer layer covering a low-index substrate. Using imaging with a near-field optical microscope and end-fire coupling with a tapered fiber connected to a tunable laser at telecommunication wavelengths (1425–1545?nm), we demonstrate low-loss (propagation length \${\textbackslash}sim\$500?μm) and well-confined (mode width \${\textbackslash}sim\$1?μm) {LR}-{DLSPPW} mode guiding and determine the propagation and bend loss.},

In the experiment the bit error rate penalties do not exceed 0.6 {dB} over the 15 nm wavelength range and received optical power between −7 and 3 {dBm}.},
